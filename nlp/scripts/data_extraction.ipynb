      "   ii  ABSTRACT  On Tutuila, the main island in the territory of American Samoa, nearly all of the island's residents rely on groundwater resources\n",
      "However, the municipal water system has been subjected to a boil water notice since 2009 due the influence of surface based contamination of groundwater in the island's most developed region, the Tafuna-Leone Plain\n",
      "The American Samoa EPA has identified three predominant anthropogenic non-point pollution sources of concern: On-Site Disposal Systems (OSDS), agricultural chemicals, and livestock (pig) manure\n",
      "Development has placed all of these sources within close proximity to many drinking water wells, and water quality analyses indicate that elevated levels of total dissolved groundwater nitrogen (TN) are linked to population density\n",
      "This suggests the potential to use TN as a tracer of groundwater contamination from the aforementioned activities, which may act as sources of more harmful pollutants\n",
      "In this study, land-use and hydrological data are integrated with water quality analysis in an N-loading and transport modeling framework for the purpose of quantifying and partitioning the water quality impacts from human land use in the Tafuna-Leone Plain\n",
      "The integrated framework consists of a numerical groundwater flow model coupled with a GIS based N-loading model and a multi-species contaminant transport model\n",
      "Nitrogen from each source is modeled as a separate species in order to trace the impact from individual areas\n",
      "The results are validated with nutrient and isotopic data, and also by assessing historical water quality records and land-use changes over time\n",
      "Results indicate that OSDS contribute significantly more TN to the aquifer than other sources, and thus should be prioritized in future water quality management efforts\n",

      "INTRODUCTION  On many small tropical volcanic islands, groundwater resources are critically important, yet they can also be vulnerable to anthropogenic non-point source contamination\n",
      "Groundwater provides about 90% of the drinking water on Tutuila, the main island in the territory of American Samoa (AS-DOC, 2013)\n",
      "However, much of the island’s municipal water is unsafe to drink without disinfection, and has been under a boil-water-advisory since 2009 (Chen, 2013)\n",
      "Groundwater in Tutuila’s most populated area, the Tafuna-Leone Plain, is especially vulnerable due to the region’s geologic setting and high development density\n",
      "The plain's young lava flows and thin ash units are characterized by an exceptionally high infiltration capacity (Eyre, 1994)\n",
      "This, combined with the high annual rainfall, creates highly productive aquifers\n",
      "However, such conditions also limit the soil’s ability to attenuate contaminants, leaving the groundwater susceptible to rapid transport of pollutants derived from surface activities (Kennedy/Jenks/Chilton, 1987)\n",
      "Previous investigations have linked turbidity and E.coli detections in wells to heavy rain events, further supporting the link between subsurface transport pathways and contamination from surface based pollutants (ASPA, 2012)\n",
      "The American Samoa Environmental Protection Agency (AS-EPA) recognizes a high groundwater contamination potential from non-point sources, including: septic tanks and cesspools, also known as On-Site wastewater Disposal Systems (OSDS), agricultural applications of fertilizers and pesticides, and manure from small backyard scale pig rearing operations termed piggeries (AS-EPA, 2010)\n",
      "These sources of groundwater pollution pose both human health and environmental water quality risks\n",
      "Wastewater and animal manures contain pathogens such as bacteria, protozoa, and viruses (Burkholder et al., 2007; Whittier & El-Kadi, 2009)\n",
      "In addition, inefficient agricultural practices can leach nutrients and toxic organic compounds into aquifers (Oki & Giambelluca, 1987)\n",
      " Wastewater influence on drinking water supplies has been identified as a major cause of waterborne disease outbreak, even in developed countries (Hrudey & Hrudey, 2007), and nutrient pollution from these sources has been linked to degradation of environmental water quality on other tropical islands (Dailer et al., 2012; Bishop et al., 2015)\n",
      " On Tutuila, the primary anthropogenic groundwater pollutants of concern are: pathogens, excessive nutrients, pesticides, and herbicides (Eyre, 1994; Kantor et al., 1996)\n",
      " 2      Unfortunately, directly testing for many of these constituents is limited by low contaminant concentrations, non-conservative behavior, and high analysis costs\n",
      "However, in other settings elevated levels of groundwater nitrogen have been clearly linked to wastewater, manure, and agricultural contamination (El-Kadi & Yabusaki, 1996; Gardner & Vogel, 2005; Verstraeten et al., 2005; Burkholder et al., 2007)\n",
      "A study by Mair & El-Kadi (2013) found that on Oahu, Hawaii, concentrations of groundwater nitrate (NO3-) could be used as a predictive indicator for the occurrence of other harder to measure anthropogenic contaminants such as solvents, fumigants, and pesticides\n",
      "Nitrate concentrations in Tutuila’s aquifers are generally below the EPA drinking water quality regulatory limit of 710 µM(N) (10 mg/L), and are thus not a health risk themselves\n",
      "However, both groundwater and surface water dissolved nitrogen concentrations on the island are correlated with population density in watersheds (DiDonato, 2005; Appendix B, Fig\n",
      "B1)\n",
      "This suggests that total dissolved groundwater nitrogen (TN) is a suitable tracer of human land-use impact on groundwater quality\n",
      " Integrating geochemical tracers with numerical contaminant-transport models is a widely used practice for tracking groundwater contaminants, although relatively few studies have applied this combined approach in volcanic island settings\n",
      "The isotopic signature of nitrogen in groundwater nitrate (δ15N) is a common tracer for distinguishing between different N-sources (Kendall & Aravena, 2000; Hunt, 2007), and isotope mass balance has been used to partition relative contributions from each source (Cole et al., 2006)\n",
      "Additionally, GIS based N-loading models are frequently used to account for the spatial distribution of nitrogen sources, especially when sources are co-linearly distributed throughout the landscape, such as they are on Tutuila (Valiela et al., 1997; Whittier & El-Kadi, 2009)\n",
      "More comprehensive studies have coupled N-loading models with numerical groundwater flow and contaminant transport models, such as MT3DMS (Zheng & Wang, 1999), to simulate nitrogen transport from point and non-point sources (Conan et al., 2003; Almasri & Kaluarachchi, 2007; Morgan et al., 2007)\n",
      "This study applies similar methods in a small tropical island setting, to answer a persistent question about which management actions are needed to reduce drinking water contamination potential\n",
      "   3      The specific objectives of this research are: 1) Quantification of groundwater quality impact from – OSDS, agriculture, and piggeries – on the Tafuna-Leone Plain\n",
      " 2) Development of a predictive tool for assessing the potential risk of groundwater contamination at future well development locations in the Tafuna-Leone Plain\n",
      " 3) Evaluation of groundwater quality impacts due to future land-use change or management efforts on Tutuila\n",
      " 4) Development of a geochemical sampling and modeling framework that is adaptable for contamination risk assessment on similar tropical islands\n",
      "  To achieve these objectives, the distribution of groundwater TN is used to trace and rank the relative water quality impact of the island’s three primary contamination sources - OSDS, agriculture, and piggeries\n",
      "Nutrient and stable isotope data from wells and springs are integrated in a groundwater loading and transport modeling framework to simulate TN concentrations and N-isotopic values in the Tafuna-Leone Plain\n",
      "The modeling framework is intended to be used as a resource management tool, which can be modified to explore the potential effects of proposed management actions\n",
      "The model is used to test a number of land-use management scenarios that were collaboratively developed with water resource management stakeholders on Tutuila\n",
      "The results of this study are useful for prioritizing water resources management efforts, guiding future water development, and providing a conceptual framework for understanding and quantifying groundwater contaminant transport on Tutuila\n",

      "METHODS 2.1 - REGIONAL SETTING AND MAJOR LAND-USE CHARACTERISTICS   The Samoan Archipelago is located in the tropical South Pacific Ocean, about halfway between New Zealand and the Hawaiian Islands\n",
      "The island of Tutuila serves as the political and cultural center of the Territory of American Samoa, and at 137 km2, is the largest island in the territory (Fig\n",
      "1)\n",
      " The climate is hot and humid, with plentiful rainfall averaging 3,000 to 6,000 mm/year (Craig, 2002)\n",
      "Tutuila can be divided into two primary geographic regions: a fairly pristine mountainous interior and a flat coastal (Tafuna-Leone) plain, where the majority of the island’s population resides\n",
      "The island’s inhabitants are distributed among 74 distinct villages that have historically controlled the necessary residential and agricultural infrastructure to be self-supporting administrative units (Coulter, 1941; Perry, 1986)\n",
      "As a result, Tutuila’s landscape is well mixed and poorly zoned, with each village containing a fairly even distribution of the land-use activities that act as non-point groundwater pollution sources\n",
      " Primary land-use types examined in this study are 1) piggeries, 2) agricultural plantations, and 3) residential areas (with OSDS units)\n",
      "Raising pigs is common for many of the island’s families, and remains a staple of traditional culture\n",
      "Despite the cultural importance of pigs, awareness of their potential to pollute environmental waters has recently grown (NRCS, 2007)\n",
      "Pig waste is high in nutrients, creates a large biological oxygen demand, and is a source of pathogens and parasites (AS-IPMC, 2004; Burkholder, 2007)\n",
      "Agriculture in American Samoa is widespread, and more than half of all arable land is under cultivation\n",
      "A significant portion of the island’s food supply is grown locally, and the island’s 5,800 farms produce about $50 million worth of products annually (US-DOA, 2011)\n",
      "A number of the island’s farms are thought to be heavy users of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides, many of which are illegally imported and subjected to poor regulation (Miller, 2013)\n",
      " About 60% of Tutuila’s residents rely on OSDS units consisting of cesspools or often improperly constructed septic systems for wastewater disposal (DiDonato & Paselio, 2006)\n",
      "The remaining 40% are served by municipal wastewater collection systems\n",
      " Prevalent OSDS have been widely implicated as sources of groundwater contamination on Tutuila, and much of the island’s thin soil is poorly developed with limited contaminant attenuation capacity (Falkland, 2002)\n",
      "Despite this fact, a 5      large percentage of the island’s OSDS units are cesspools, where raw untreated wastewater is allowed to infiltrate directly into the ground\n",

      "To obtain these data, groundwater sampling was conducted at 32 wells and springs in the Tafuna-Leone Plain region between August 2013 and August 2015 (Fig\n",
      "2)\n",
      "Most samples were collected during Samoa’s dry season (June to August), although 10 repeated samples were collected at four sites during both seasons to ensure that temporal variation during the sampling period was insignificant\n",
      "For locations that were sampled multiple times (n = 1 to 10), the mean value from all samples taken at the site was used in model calibration\n",
      " Production wells were sampled at wellhead collection ports, and pumps were run long enough to ensure effective purging of the well bore\n",
      "Coastal springs were sampled with a peristaltic pump and a handheld piezometer, which was temporarily installed in each spring\n",
      "All samples were filtered on-site with 0.45 µm hydrophilic polyethersulfone capsule filters that were purged long enough to ensure adequate flushing of the water delivery line and to avoid carry-over contamination between samples\n",
      "Temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity were measured in situ with a YSI multiparameter sonde\n",
      "All samples were collected in triple-rinsed, acid washed 60 ml HDPE bottles and were cooled during transport to storage facilities\n",
      "Nutrient samples were refrigerated for short-term storage (< 2 weeks) or frozen when longer storage times were necessary\n",
      "Nitrogen isotope samples were frozen the day of collection and thawed immediately prior to analysis\n",

      "Either of these actions on a wide enough scale should result in a significant reduction of groundwater N, and by inference, other wastewater related contaminants\n",
      "Management actions regarding piggeries or agriculture may also serve to reduce contamination vulnerability somewhat, and the relatively smaller scales of these activities may make effective management easier to enact\n",
      "Assessing the efficacy of these or other actions by running land-use change scenarios with the model presented in this study may be useful for management planning efforts\n",
      " The model can also be used for obtaining a general, though indirect, estimate of TN attenuation rates affecting the three modeled N-sources on the island\n",
      "Although, it must be noted that these attenuation rates are more uncertain than rates derived from a dedicated N-attenuation model, since they were derived via calibration and not empirical observations\n",
      "Regardless, the magnitude of the calibrated N-attenuation factors, at least qualitatively, can highlight important issues\n",
      "For example, the modeled agricultural attenuation rate of 48% indicates that less than half of all applied fertilizers are used by plants (or are lost in other ways), whereas the other half ends up leaching to the aquifer\n",
      "This suggests that in general, synthetic fertilizers are being over-applied on Tutuila\n",
      "Although agricultural inputs are not the island’s most significant contributors of groundwater TN, this result nonetheless indicates potential for groundwater contamination, should there be a widespread increase in fertilizer application\n",
      "This underscores the importance of developing agricultural regulations, permitting requirements, and management practices in a rapidly developing setting such as Tutuila\n",
      "An important step in agricultural management on Tutuila would be to develop a more detailed inventory of agricultural areas and rates of fertilizer, pesticide, and herbicide applications\n",
      "A higher resolution agricultural dataset could be used with this modeling framework to provide a more reliable assessment of fertilizer fate and agriculturally sourced water quality issues\n",
      "31       In this study, piggery-sourced groundwater contamination was shown to be less important than many previous studies have suggested (Falkland, 2002; AS-EPA, 2005)\n",
      "However, pig manure’s effects on groundwater quality are probably secondary to its effects on surface water quality\n",
      "In contrast to OSDS wastewater, which is essentially injected into the subsurface, pig manure is generally discharged directly to the ground’s surface making it more likely to be removed by surface runoff\n",
      "The higher modeled attenuation coefficient (90%) for pig nitrogen supports this conclusion\n",
      "Assessment of the efficacy of piggery management efforts should therefore focus on surface water quality as opposed to groundwater quality\n",
      "4.2 - MODEL VALIDITY AND LIMITATIONS  Assessing the validity of this model’s results requires determining how well the MT3DMS model predicts the fraction of impact from each source\n",
      "Here, this was accomplished by using a δ15N mixing model and comparing its results against measured nitrogen isotope data\n",
      "This method relied on identifying a distinctive end member δ15N value for each of the mixed N-sources\n",
      "However, in reality, the N-source end-members probably span a range of δ15N values due to variable degrees of fractionation throughout the evolution of N from individual locales\n",
      "This concern is commonly brought up in other studies that use isotopic values for source discrimination (Kendall & McDonnell, 1998; Ransom, 2015)\n",
      "For example, overlapping δ15N ranges from manure and OSDS δ15N are an important concern, but in this study, the simplifying assumption that each has a unique endmember value was made\n",
      "The validity of this assumption remains a subject of debate, so for this study, ancillary information regarding the magnitude of impact from these two sources was also explored to better understand pig manure’s potential to be a significant factor in the observed high groundwater δ15N values\n",
      " This was accomplished by comparing historical water quality and pig census data from the last decade\n",
      "Piggery data shows a clear decline, of about 38%, in the number of pigs on the island over the last 10 years (AS-EPA, 2005; AS-EPA, 2013)\n",
      "If pigs were a significant source of groundwater nitrogen, a reduction of this scale would be expected to diminish nitrogen concentrations by a measurable amount, considering the plain’s relatively rapid groundwater movement\n",
      "However, average NO3- concentrations taken from sixteen Tafuna-Leone wells during annual US-EPA drinking water quality compliance testing do not follow a similar trend (Fig\n",
      "13)\n",
      "Instead, NO3- values in groundwater averaged around 50 µM between 2005 and 2015 32      and did not show a significant change over this time period\n",
      "This supports the conclusion that high TN and δ15N groundwater is more likely to be impacted by OSDS rather than piggeries, since pigs do not seem to be major nitrogen contributors to groundwater\n",
      " The mixing model validation approach also relies on the assumption that δ15N values of NO3- and of TN in Tutuila’s groundwater are equivalent, since the model uses TN values but the δ15N analysis only measures δ15N(NO3-)\n",
      "This discrepancy was accepted because T-L Plain groundwater is generally well oxygenated, and thus, about 90% of TN is in the oxidized form of NO3-\n",
      "Generally high groundwater DO concentrations also suggest that denitrification is not likely to be a significant process within the aquifer\n",
      "The process of denitrification is a biologically mediated N-attenuation process that occurs in anoxic environments\n",
      "It modifies δ15N values and reduces TN concentrations as water flows through the saturated zone\n",
      "However, on Tutuila, groundwater is well oxygenated, TN concentrations generally increase down groundwater flow-paths, and there are low concentrations of total organic carbon (a fuel supply for denitrifiers) in the subsurface\n",
      "These pieces of evidence imply that TN acts and moves conservatively while in the aquifer, and denitrification is not a significant process affecting TN concentrations or δ15N signatures\n",

      "Elevated levels of groundwater nitrogen in areas of human influence suggest the suitability of using dissolved TN as a tracer of anthropogenic water quality impacts\n",
      "In this study, land-use data and hydrological parameters were integrated to develop a multi-species contaminant transport modeling framework intended to quantify and partition these impacts\n",
      "The spatial distribution of TN in Tutuila’s groundwater was found to be heterogeneous and primarily dependent on the prevalence of non-point sources located up gradient from the point of observation\n",
      "By estimating the locations and TN contributions of these sources, the model was able to explain almost 70% of the observed variability in groundwater N concentrations\n",
      "Results indicate that OSDS have a much larger influence on groundwater quality than do piggeries or agricultural practices\n",
      "Quantitative ranking of sources was validated with a Monte Carlo based optimization method, which clearly showed model error minima and correlation maxima at average             %-influence values of 61%, 15%, 13%, and 11% from OSDS, pigs, agriculture and soil sources, respectively\n",
      "The reliability of the model predictions was validated with an isotope mixing model, which provided a way to assess the modeled N-fractions based on measured δ15N values\n",
      "Additionally, these results were supported by examining historical water quality and land-use data, which showed stable average concentrations of NO3- in production wells despite sharp declines in piggery numbers over the last decade\n",
      "The calibrated model was then used to quantify the effects of hypothetical resource management scenarios on groundwater quality\n",
      "This modeling framework serves as an example for source partitioning of co-linearly distributed non-point sources of contamination, on small tropical islands, to aid in the design of best management practices\n",
      "  37      APPENDIX A:  OBSERVATION POINT SELECTION METHODS  A.1 - MODFLOW observation points\n",
      "  The MODFLOW model was re-calibrated with static water levels from 17 observation points taken during a synoptic water level survey in 2014  (Appendix C, Table C1)\n",
      "Recovery tests were performed on each well and once the wells were fully recovered (usually 4 to 24 hours) the water level was recorded\n",
      "Since wells in the ASPA system are almost always pumping, the measured water levels did not actually represent normal steady state conditions at the measured locations because drawdown effects were almost always present\n",
      "To account for this, the measured water level was instead assigned to a point near the well and on the same equipotential contour line, but outside of the well’s estimated cone of depression\n",
      "These ‘hypothetical observation points’ were assumed to have the same water levels as those in the stopped wells, but during normal pumping conditions\n",
      "The hypothetical observation points were located at the intersection of the outer edge of the well’s cone of depression and the equipotential line in the regional groundwater flow field (Fig\n",
      "A1)\n",
      "The regional flow field was estimated from the Izuka et al\n",
      "(2007) model, and the cone of depression was estimated based on the well discharge and the recharge rate around the well (Todd & Mays, 2005)\n",

      "  Measured TN values from water samples were incorporated into the MT3DMS model as observation points\n",
      "It was found that observation points whose locations were arbitrarily close to a cell boundary were not able to represent the sharp modeled concentration gradients between adjacent cells, because the MT3DMS model computed TN concentrations at the center of each cell, regardless of where the actual location of the observation point fell\n",
      "To compensate for this, the observation point was assigned the median TN value of all cells that fell within a 45 m radius (one half of the cell width) from the actual well or spring location\n",
      "This method produced simulated TN concentrations that better approximated the observed data\n",
      "  39      APPENDIX B:  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION  B.1 - Calibration Assessment Measures   Model performance is typically assessed by comparing observed values of a parameter against the corresponding modeled values\n",
      "Correlation-based and error-based statistical measures are commonly used to assess the model fit (Almasri & Kaluarachchi, 2007)\n",
      "Though there are many approaches that are appropriate for this purpose, in this study, the following measures were selected as metrics of model performance: 1) the coefficient of determination (r2), 2) the least mean squares regression coefficients (slope and intercept), 3) the modified index of agreement (d1), 4) the mean average error (MAE), and 5) the mean relative error (MRE)\n",
      "The modified index of agreement (d1) is a correlation based measure and is defined by:  𝑑1 = 1 − ∑|𝑂𝑖−𝑆𝑖|𝑛𝑖=1∑(|𝑆𝑖−𝑂̅|+|𝑂𝑖−𝑂̅|)𝑛𝑖=1 (B1) (Legates and McCabe, 1999), where n is the number of observations, Oi is the measured value at observation point i, and Si is the corresponding modeled value at point i\n",
      "The value of d1 ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values representing better model fit\n",
      "This metric is similar to the coefficient of determination (r2)\n",
      "However, while r2 describes how much of the total variance within the observed values can be explained by the model, it only quantifies the relative dispersion in the data and does not account for systematic over or under predictions\n",
      "The modified index of agreement (d1) represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error, which is intended to overcome the insensitivity of r2 to systematic errors\n",
      " Additionally, the slope and intercept of the observed vs\n",
      "simulated LMS regression are also useful indicators of systematic over or under predictions (Krause et al., 2005)\n",
      " The error-based measures used in this study assess goodness-of-fit based on quantifying the differences between observed and modeled values\n",
      "They include the mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean relative error (MRE), which are described by: 𝑀𝐴𝐸 = ∑ |𝑂𝑖−𝑆𝑖|𝑛𝑖𝑛                                                                  (B2) 40      and 𝑀𝑅𝐸 = √∑ (𝑂𝑖−𝑆𝑖)2𝑛𝑖𝑛 × 1∆                                                     (B3) (Anderson and Woessner, 1992; Almasri & Kaluarachchi, 2007), where Δ is the range between the highest and lowest values in the observed data\n",
      "These metrics both represent the average of all errors between observed and modeled points\n",

      "Higher efficiency OSDS units designed and installed by ASPA may be able to achieve nitrogen and/or other contaminant attenuation in packed beds directly below the units\n",
      "A hypothetical increase of 25% was applied to the OSDS attenuation rate (for a final value of 69% attenuation) in the model to simulate the potential increase in attenuation that such a strategy may produce\n",

      "However, the municipal water system has been subjected to a boil water notice since 2009 due the influence of surface based contamination of groundwater in the island's most developed region, the Tafuna-Leone Plain\n",
      "The American Samoa EPA has identified three predominant anthropogenic non-point pollution sources of concern: On-Site Disposal Systems (OSDS), agricultural chemicals, and livestock (pig) manure\n",
      "Development has placed all of these sources within close proximity to many drinking water wells, and water quality analyses indicate that elevated levels of total dissolved groundwater nitrogen (TN) are linked to population density\n",
      "This suggests the potential to use TN as a tracer of groundwater contamination from the aforementioned activities, which may act as sources of more harmful pollutants\n",
      "In this study, land-use and hydrological data are integrated with water quality analysis in an N-loading and transport modeling framework for the purpose of quantifying and partitioning the water quality impacts from human land use in the Tafuna-Leone Plain\n",
      "The integrated framework consists of a numerical groundwater flow model coupled with a GIS based N-loading model and a multi-species contaminant transport model\n",
      "Nitrogen from each source is modeled as a separate species in order to trace the impact from individual areas\n",
      "The results are validated with nutrient and isotopic data, and also by assessing historical water quality records and land-use changes over time\n",
      "Results indicate that OSDS contribute significantly more TN to the aquifer than other sources, and thus should be prioritized in future water quality management efforts\n",

      "INTRODUCTION  On many small tropical volcanic islands, groundwater resources are critically important, yet they can also be vulnerable to anthropogenic non-point source contamination\n",
      "Groundwater provides about 90% of the drinking water on Tutuila, the main island in the territory of American Samoa (AS-DOC, 2013)\n",
      "However, much of the island’s municipal water is unsafe to drink without disinfection, and has been under a boil-water-advisory since 2009 (Chen, 2013)\n",
      "Groundwater in Tutuila’s most populated area, the Tafuna-Leone Plain, is especially vulnerable due to the region’s geologic setting and high development density\n",
      "The plain's young lava flows and thin ash units are characterized by an exceptionally high infiltration capacity (Eyre, 1994)\n",
      "This, combined with the high annual rainfall, creates highly productive aquifers\n",
      "However, such conditions also limit the soil’s ability to attenuate contaminants, leaving the groundwater susceptible to rapid transport of pollutants derived from surface activities (Kennedy/Jenks/Chilton, 1987)\n",
      "Previous investigations have linked turbidity and E.coli detections in wells to heavy rain events, further supporting the link between subsurface transport pathways and contamination from surface based pollutants (ASPA, 2012)\n",
      "The American Samoa Environmental Protection Agency (AS-EPA) recognizes a high groundwater contamination potential from non-point sources, including: septic tanks and cesspools, also known as On-Site wastewater Disposal Systems (OSDS), agricultural applications of fertilizers and pesticides, and manure from small backyard scale pig rearing operations termed piggeries (AS-EPA, 2010)\n",
      "These sources of groundwater pollution pose both human health and environmental water quality risks\n",
      "Wastewater and animal manures contain pathogens such as bacteria, protozoa, and viruses (Burkholder et al., 2007; Whittier & El-Kadi, 2009)\n",
      "In addition, inefficient agricultural practices can leach nutrients and toxic organic compounds into aquifers (Oki & Giambelluca, 1987)\n",
      " Wastewater influence on drinking water supplies has been identified as a major cause of waterborne disease outbreak, even in developed countries (Hrudey & Hrudey, 2007), and nutrient pollution from these sources has been linked to degradation of environmental water quality on other tropical islands (Dailer et al., 2012; Bishop et al., 2015)\n",
      " On Tutuila, the primary anthropogenic groundwater pollutants of concern are: pathogens, excessive nutrients, pesticides, and herbicides (Eyre, 1994; Kantor et al., 1996)\n",
      " 2      Unfortunately, directly testing for many of these constituents is limited by low contaminant concentrations, non-conservative behavior, and high analysis costs\n",
      "However, in other settings elevated levels of groundwater nitrogen have been clearly linked to wastewater, manure, and agricultural contamination (El-Kadi & Yabusaki, 1996; Gardner & Vogel, 2005; Verstraeten et al., 2005; Burkholder et al., 2007)\n",
      "A study by Mair & El-Kadi (2013) found that on Oahu, Hawaii, concentrations of groundwater nitrate (NO3-) could be used as a predictive indicator for the occurrence of other harder to measure anthropogenic contaminants such as solvents, fumigants, and pesticides\n",
      "Nitrate concentrations in Tutuila’s aquifers are generally below the EPA drinking water quality regulatory limit of 710 µM(N) (10 mg/L), and are thus not a health risk themselves\n",
      "However, both groundwater and surface water dissolved nitrogen concentrations on the island are correlated with population density in watersheds (DiDonato, 2005; Appendix B, Fig\n",
      "B1)\n",
      "This suggests that total dissolved groundwater nitrogen (TN) is a suitable tracer of human land-use impact on groundwater quality\n",
      " Integrating geochemical tracers with numerical contaminant-transport models is a widely used practice for tracking groundwater contaminants, although relatively few studies have applied this combined approach in volcanic island settings\n",
      "The isotopic signature of nitrogen in groundwater nitrate (δ15N) is a common tracer for distinguishing between different N-sources (Kendall & Aravena, 2000; Hunt, 2007), and isotope mass balance has been used to partition relative contributions from each source (Cole et al., 2006)\n",
      "Additionally, GIS based N-loading models are frequently used to account for the spatial distribution of nitrogen sources, especially when sources are co-linearly distributed throughout the landscape, such as they are on Tutuila (Valiela et al., 1997; Whittier & El-Kadi, 2009)\n",
      "More comprehensive studies have coupled N-loading models with numerical groundwater flow and contaminant transport models, such as MT3DMS (Zheng & Wang, 1999), to simulate nitrogen transport from point and non-point sources (Conan et al., 2003; Almasri & Kaluarachchi, 2007; Morgan et al., 2007)\n",
      "This study applies similar methods in a small tropical island setting, to answer a persistent question about which management actions are needed to reduce drinking water contamination potential\n",
      "   3      The specific objectives of this research are: 1) Quantification of groundwater quality impact from – OSDS, agriculture, and piggeries – on the Tafuna-Leone Plain\n",
      " 2) Development of a predictive tool for assessing the potential risk of groundwater contamination at future well development locations in the Tafuna-Leone Plain\n",
      " 3) Evaluation of groundwater quality impacts due to future land-use change or management efforts on Tutuila\n",
      " 4) Development of a geochemical sampling and modeling framework that is adaptable for contamination risk assessment on similar tropical islands\n",
      "  To achieve these objectives, the distribution of groundwater TN is used to trace and rank the relative water quality impact of the island’s three primary contamination sources - OSDS, agriculture, and piggeries\n",
      "Nutrient and stable isotope data from wells and springs are integrated in a groundwater loading and transport modeling framework to simulate TN concentrations and N-isotopic values in the Tafuna-Leone Plain\n",
      "The modeling framework is intended to be used as a resource management tool, which can be modified to explore the potential effects of proposed management actions\n",
      "The model is used to test a number of land-use management scenarios that were collaboratively developed with water resource management stakeholders on Tutuila\n",
      "The results of this study are useful for prioritizing water resources management efforts, guiding future water development, and providing a conceptual framework for understanding and quantifying groundwater contaminant transport on Tutuila\n",

      "METHODS 2.1 - REGIONAL SETTING AND MAJOR LAND-USE CHARACTERISTICS   The Samoan Archipelago is located in the tropical South Pacific Ocean, about halfway between New Zealand and the Hawaiian Islands\n",
      "The island of Tutuila serves as the political and cultural center of the Territory of American Samoa, and at 137 km2, is the largest island in the territory (Fig\n",
      "1)\n",
      " The climate is hot and humid, with plentiful rainfall averaging 3,000 to 6,000 mm/year (Craig, 2002)\n",
      "Tutuila can be divided into two primary geographic regions: a fairly pristine mountainous interior and a flat coastal (Tafuna-Leone) plain, where the majority of the island’s population resides\n",
      "The island’s inhabitants are distributed among 74 distinct villages that have historically controlled the necessary residential and agricultural infrastructure to be self-supporting administrative units (Coulter, 1941; Perry, 1986)\n",
      "As a result, Tutuila’s landscape is well mixed and poorly zoned, with each village containing a fairly even distribution of the land-use activities that act as non-point groundwater pollution sources\n",
      " Primary land-use types examined in this study are 1) piggeries, 2) agricultural plantations, and 3) residential areas (with OSDS units)\n",
      "Raising pigs is common for many of the island’s families, and remains a staple of traditional culture\n",
      "Despite the cultural importance of pigs, awareness of their potential to pollute environmental waters has recently grown (NRCS, 2007)\n",
      "Pig waste is high in nutrients, creates a large biological oxygen demand, and is a source of pathogens and parasites (AS-IPMC, 2004; Burkholder, 2007)\n",
      "Agriculture in American Samoa is widespread, and more than half of all arable land is under cultivation\n",
      "A significant portion of the island’s food supply is grown locally, and the island’s 5,800 farms produce about $50 million worth of products annually (US-DOA, 2011)\n",
      "A number of the island’s farms are thought to be heavy users of synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides, many of which are illegally imported and subjected to poor regulation (Miller, 2013)\n",
      " About 60% of Tutuila’s residents rely on OSDS units consisting of cesspools or often improperly constructed septic systems for wastewater disposal (DiDonato & Paselio, 2006)\n",
      "The remaining 40% are served by municipal wastewater collection systems\n",
      " Prevalent OSDS have been widely implicated as sources of groundwater contamination on Tutuila, and much of the island’s thin soil is poorly developed with limited contaminant attenuation capacity (Falkland, 2002)\n",
      "Despite this fact, a 5      large percentage of the island’s OSDS units are cesspools, where raw untreated wastewater is allowed to infiltrate directly into the ground\n",

      "To obtain these data, groundwater sampling was conducted at 32 wells and springs in the Tafuna-Leone Plain region between August 2013 and August 2015 (Fig\n",
      "2)\n",
      "Most samples were collected during Samoa’s dry season (June to August), although 10 repeated samples were collected at four sites during both seasons to ensure that temporal variation during the sampling period was insignificant\n",
      "For locations that were sampled multiple times (n = 1 to 10), the mean value from all samples taken at the site was used in model calibration\n",
      " Production wells were sampled at wellhead collection ports, and pumps were run long enough to ensure effective purging of the well bore\n",
      "Coastal springs were sampled with a peristaltic pump and a handheld piezometer, which was temporarily installed in each spring\n",
      "All samples were filtered on-site with 0.45 µm hydrophilic polyethersulfone capsule filters that were purged long enough to ensure adequate flushing of the water delivery line and to avoid carry-over contamination between samples\n",
      "Temperature, salinity, pH, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity were measured in situ with a YSI multiparameter sonde\n",
      "All samples were collected in triple-rinsed, acid washed 60 ml HDPE bottles and were cooled during transport to storage facilities\n",
      "Nutrient samples were refrigerated for short-term storage (< 2 weeks) or frozen when longer storage times were necessary\n",
      "Nitrogen isotope samples were frozen the day of collection and thawed immediately prior to analysis\n",
      "Nutrient samples were analyzed within 1 month, while δ15N samples were analyzed within 4 months of collection\n",
      " Nutrient samples were analyzed for concentrations of dissolved phosphate (PO43-), silicate (SiO44-), nitrate (NO3- ), nitrite (NO2-), ammonium (NH4+), total nitrogen (TN), total organic carbon (TOC), and total phosphorus (TP) by the University of Hawaii SOEST Laboratory for Analytical Biogeochemistry, using the methods described in Grasshoff et al\n",

      "Since generating human waste is unavoidable, reduction of wastewater discharge on Tutuila could be accomplished by either installing wastewater collection systems (sewers) or replacing cesspools and inefficient septic tanks with higher efficiency OSDS units\n",
      "Either of these actions on a wide enough scale should result in a significant reduction of groundwater N, and by inference, other wastewater related contaminants\n",
      "Management actions regarding piggeries or agriculture may also serve to reduce contamination vulnerability somewhat, and the relatively smaller scales of these activities may make effective management easier to enact\n",
      "Assessing the efficacy of these or other actions by running land-use change scenarios with the model presented in this study may be useful for management planning efforts\n",
      " The model can also be used for obtaining a general, though indirect, estimate of TN attenuation rates affecting the three modeled N-sources on the island\n",
      "Although, it must be noted that these attenuation rates are more uncertain than rates derived from a dedicated N-attenuation model, since they were derived via calibration and not empirical observations\n",
      "Regardless, the magnitude of the calibrated N-attenuation factors, at least qualitatively, can highlight important issues\n",
      "For example, the modeled agricultural attenuation rate of 48% indicates that less than half of all applied fertilizers are used by plants (or are lost in other ways), whereas the other half ends up leaching to the aquifer\n",
      "This suggests that in general, synthetic fertilizers are being over-applied on Tutuila\n",
      "Although agricultural inputs are not the island’s most significant contributors of groundwater TN, this result nonetheless indicates potential for groundwater contamination, should there be a widespread increase in fertilizer application\n",
      "This underscores the importance of developing agricultural regulations, permitting requirements, and management practices in a rapidly developing setting such as Tutuila\n",
      "An important step in agricultural management on Tutuila would be to develop a more detailed inventory of agricultural areas and rates of fertilizer, pesticide, and herbicide applications\n",
      "A higher resolution agricultural dataset could be used with this modeling framework to provide a more reliable assessment of fertilizer fate and agriculturally sourced water quality issues\n",
      "31       In this study, piggery-sourced groundwater contamination was shown to be less important than many previous studies have suggested (Falkland, 2002; AS-EPA, 2005)\n",
      "However, pig manure’s effects on groundwater quality are probably secondary to its effects on surface water quality\n",
      "In contrast to OSDS wastewater, which is essentially injected into the subsurface, pig manure is generally discharged directly to the ground’s surface making it more likely to be removed by surface runoff\n",
      "The higher modeled attenuation coefficient (90%) for pig nitrogen supports this conclusion\n",
      "Assessment of the efficacy of piggery management efforts should therefore focus on surface water quality as opposed to groundwater quality\n",
      "4.2 - MODEL VALIDITY AND LIMITATIONS  Assessing the validity of this model’s results requires determining how well the MT3DMS model predicts the fraction of impact from each source\n",
      "Here, this was accomplished by using a δ15N mixing model and comparing its results against measured nitrogen isotope data\n",
      "This method relied on identifying a distinctive end member δ15N value for each of the mixed N-sources\n",
      "However, in reality, the N-source end-members probably span a range of δ15N values due to variable degrees of fractionation throughout the evolution of N from individual locales\n",
      "This concern is commonly brought up in other studies that use isotopic values for source discrimination (Kendall & McDonnell, 1998; Ransom, 2015)\n",
      "For example, overlapping δ15N ranges from manure and OSDS δ15N are an important concern, but in this study, the simplifying assumption that each has a unique endmember value was made\n",
      "The validity of this assumption remains a subject of debate, so for this study, ancillary information regarding the magnitude of impact from these two sources was also explored to better understand pig manure’s potential to be a significant factor in the observed high groundwater δ15N values\n",
      " This was accomplished by comparing historical water quality and pig census data from the last decade\n",
      "Piggery data shows a clear decline, of about 38%, in the number of pigs on the island over the last 10 years (AS-EPA, 2005; AS-EPA, 2013)\n",
      "If pigs were a significant source of groundwater nitrogen, a reduction of this scale would be expected to diminish nitrogen concentrations by a measurable amount, considering the plain’s relatively rapid groundwater movement\n",
      "However, average NO3- concentrations taken from sixteen Tafuna-Leone wells during annual US-EPA drinking water quality compliance testing do not follow a similar trend (Fig\n",
      "13)\n",
      "Instead, NO3- values in groundwater averaged around 50 µM between 2005 and 2015 32      and did not show a significant change over this time period\n",
      "This supports the conclusion that high TN and δ15N groundwater is more likely to be impacted by OSDS rather than piggeries, since pigs do not seem to be major nitrogen contributors to groundwater\n",
      " The mixing model validation approach also relies on the assumption that δ15N values of NO3- and of TN in Tutuila’s groundwater are equivalent, since the model uses TN values but the δ15N analysis only measures δ15N(NO3-)\n",
      "This discrepancy was accepted because T-L Plain groundwater is generally well oxygenated, and thus, about 90% of TN is in the oxidized form of NO3-\n",
      "Generally high groundwater DO concentrations also suggest that denitrification is not likely to be a significant process within the aquifer\n",
      "The process of denitrification is a biologically mediated N-attenuation process that occurs in anoxic environments\n",
      "It modifies δ15N values and reduces TN concentrations as water flows through the saturated zone\n",
      "However, on Tutuila, groundwater is well oxygenated, TN concentrations generally increase down groundwater flow-paths, and there are low concentrations of total organic carbon (a fuel supply for denitrifiers) in the subsurface\n",
      "These pieces of evidence imply that TN acts and moves conservatively while in the aquifer, and denitrification is not a significant process affecting TN concentrations or δ15N signatures\n",
      " The modeling approach also relies on a key assumption that both the model itself and that real-world physical parameters, such as hydrologic and climactic conditions, are in a steady state during the modeled period\n",

      "  37      APPENDIX A:  OBSERVATION POINT SELECTION METHODS  A.1 - MODFLOW observation points\n",
      "  The MODFLOW model was re-calibrated with static water levels from 17 observation points taken during a synoptic water level survey in 2014  (Appendix C, Table C1)\n",
      "Recovery tests were performed on each well and once the wells were fully recovered (usually 4 to 24 hours) the water level was recorded\n",
      "Since wells in the ASPA system are almost always pumping, the measured water levels did not actually represent normal steady state conditions at the measured locations because drawdown effects were almost always present\n",
      "To account for this, the measured water level was instead assigned to a point near the well and on the same equipotential contour line, but outside of the well’s estimated cone of depression\n",
      "These ‘hypothetical observation points’ were assumed to have the same water levels as those in the stopped wells, but during normal pumping conditions\n",
      "The hypothetical observation points were located at the intersection of the outer edge of the well’s cone of depression and the equipotential line in the regional groundwater flow field (Fig\n",
      "A1)\n",
      "The regional flow field was estimated from the Izuka et al\n",
      "(2007) model, and the cone of depression was estimated based on the well discharge and the recharge rate around the well (Todd & Mays, 2005)\n",

      "  Measured TN values from water samples were incorporated into the MT3DMS model as observation points\n",
      "It was found that observation points whose locations were arbitrarily close to a cell boundary were not able to represent the sharp modeled concentration gradients between adjacent cells, because the MT3DMS model computed TN concentrations at the center of each cell, regardless of where the actual location of the observation point fell\n",
      "To compensate for this, the observation point was assigned the median TN value of all cells that fell within a 45 m radius (one half of the cell width) from the actual well or spring location\n",
      "This method produced simulated TN concentrations that better approximated the observed data\n",
      "  39      APPENDIX B:  SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION  B.1 - Calibration Assessment Measures   Model performance is typically assessed by comparing observed values of a parameter against the corresponding modeled values\n",
      "Correlation-based and error-based statistical measures are commonly used to assess the model fit (Almasri & Kaluarachchi, 2007)\n",
      "Though there are many approaches that are appropriate for this purpose, in this study, the following measures were selected as metrics of model performance: 1) the coefficient of determination (r2), 2) the least mean squares regression coefficients (slope and intercept), 3) the modified index of agreement (d1), 4) the mean average error (MAE), and 5) the mean relative error (MRE)\n",
      "The modified index of agreement (d1) is a correlation based measure and is defined by:  𝑑1 = 1 − ∑|𝑂𝑖−𝑆𝑖|𝑛𝑖=1∑(|𝑆𝑖−𝑂̅|+|𝑂𝑖−𝑂̅|)𝑛𝑖=1 (B1) (Legates and McCabe, 1999), where n is the number of observations, Oi is the measured value at observation point i, and Si is the corresponding modeled value at point i\n",
      "The value of d1 ranges from 0 to 1 with higher values representing better model fit\n",
      "This metric is similar to the coefficient of determination (r2)\n",
      "However, while r2 describes how much of the total variance within the observed values can be explained by the model, it only quantifies the relative dispersion in the data and does not account for systematic over or under predictions\n",
      "The modified index of agreement (d1) represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error, which is intended to overcome the insensitivity of r2 to systematic errors\n",
      " Additionally, the slope and intercept of the observed vs\n",
      "simulated LMS regression are also useful indicators of systematic over or under predictions (Krause et al., 2005)\n",
      " The error-based measures used in this study assess goodness-of-fit based on quantifying the differences between observed and modeled values\n",
      "They include the mean absolute error (MAE) and the mean relative error (MRE), which are described by: 𝑀𝐴𝐸 = ∑ |𝑂𝑖−𝑆𝑖|𝑛𝑖𝑛                                                                  (B2) 40      and 𝑀𝑅𝐸 = √∑ (𝑂𝑖−𝑆𝑖)2𝑛𝑖𝑛 × 1∆                                                     (B3) (Anderson and Woessner, 1992; Almasri & Kaluarachchi, 2007), where Δ is the range between the highest and lowest values in the observed data\n",
      "These metrics both represent the average of all errors between observed and modeled points\n",
